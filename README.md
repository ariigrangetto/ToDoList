<h2>ðŸ§ What I learn from TodoList:</h2>

<p>Here I moved the todoApp app made with vanilla JavaScript to the React library, where I learned the basics of it, for example array mutations.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
This is a Todo app built with React + Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. With this app you can add new to-dos, cross out or delete completed tasks. All information is stored in localStorage.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
